I designed a business card for a ficticious business as part of a <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/visual-designer/">Visual Design course</a> at <a href="https://skillcrush.com/">Skillcrush</a>.

These designs were created using <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?promoid=PC1PQQ5T&mv=other">Adobe Photoshop</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html">Adobe InDesign</a>: 

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/my-biz-card-front-FINAL.png" alt="" title="business card front"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Front of business card.
</div>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/my-biz-card-back-FINAL.png" alt="" title="business card back"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Back of card.
</div>
